=head1 NAME

Text::Trac2GFM

=head1 SYNOPSIS

As a Perl library:

    use Text::Trac2GFM qw( trac2gfm gfmtitle );

    # GitLab Wiki compatible title: 'api-users-and-accounts'
    my $gitlab_wiki_title = gfmtitle('API/Users & Accounts');

    my $gfm_page = trac2gfm($tracwiki_markup);

Using the included C<trac2gfm> command line program:

    $ trac2gfm <path to tracwiki file>

Or piped to C<STDIN>:

    $ cat <trac wiki file> | trac2gfm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions which ease the migration of TracWiki formatted
wikis (or any other content, such as ticket descriptions, which use TracWiki
markup) to GitLab projects using GitLab Flavored Markdown (GFM).

For the most part, this module assumes that your input TracWiki text is fairly
well-formed and valid. Some concessions are made for whitespace in markup that
may not be optional in TracWiki, but which we can reliably treat as such.
However, blatant violations such as an opening C<{{{> for a pre-formatted code
block that is never followed by a closing C<}}}> will break your output.
Similar breakage can occur with horribly mis-nested emphasis markup, or wildly
malformed links.

If your TracWiki markup renders properly on a Trac wiki, this module I<should>
convert it correctly (barring any special exceptions noted below). If it does
not, please file a bug (or better yet, submit a patch)!

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

This module does not export any functions by default. You must select the ones
you wish you use explicitly during module import. The following functions are
available for importing:

=head2 trac2gfm ($markup, $title_options)

Provided a scalar containing TracWiki markup, returns a scalar containing GFM
compliant markup. As many markup features as can be converted are, but please
note that GitLab-flavored Markdown does not support absolutely everything that
TracWiki does.

An optional hash reference of title options may be provided as the second
argument. The contents should be the same as what may be passed to C<gfmtitle>
and will be passed unaltered to that function whenever necessary. This ensures
that any internal wiki links which are converted as part of the markup
translation follow the same rules you may be using in your own direct
invocations of C<gfmtitle>.

If being performed as part of a wholesale Trac to GitLab migration (which is
probably the case), you will be responsible for updating the various internal
links which use identifiers that may have changed (ticket numbers, commit IDs,
etc.). Internal Wiki links will be corrected to use the GFM title format,
however, so as long as your entire wiki is converted using these functions, the
page references will come out intact. If you had been using Git repositories in
Trac, then your commit IDs will likely also remain the same (as that process
should be accomplished by simply switching remotes). Trac to GitLab conversions
which go from SVN to Git will require additional massaging to maintain the
C<[n]> changeset references.

Things that do get converted:

=over

=item * Paragraphs (should have gone without saying)

=item * Headings

=item * Emphasis (bold, italic, and underline; including nesting)

=item * Lists (numbered, bulleted, and lettered; latter being converted to bulleted)

=item * Pre-formatted text and code blocks

=item * Blockquotes

=item * Links

=item * TracLinks

=over

=item * Issues/Tickets

=item * Changesets (including mapping SVN changeset numbers to Git commit IDs)

=back

=item * Image macross (for images on the current wiki page only)

=item * Tables

=back

Things that do I<not> convert (at least not yet):

=over

=item * Definition Lists

=item * Images from anywhere other than the current wiki page

=item * Macros

=head2 gfmtitle ($title_string, $options)

Provided a single line string, C<$title_string>, returns a variant suitable for
use as the title of a GitLab Wiki page. Default mutations include replacement
of all whitespace and disallowed characters with dashes along with a reduction
to non-repeating kebab casing.

Some common technical terms that would otherwise render strangely within the
restrictions of GFM titles are replaced with more verbose versions (e.g. 'C++'
becomes 'c-plus-plus' instead of 'c-' as it would without special handling).

You may also pass in an optional hash reference containing the following
options to override some of the default behavior:

=over

=item * downcase

Defaults to true. Providing any false-y value will cause C<gfmtitle> to retain
the case of your input string, instead of lower-casing it.

=item * unslash

Defaults to true. Providing any false-y value will cause slashes (C</>) to be
retained in the output, instead of converting them to dashes (C<->). Note that
this can cause problems if you are committing your converted wiki pages into a
local Git repository - special care will be needed to escape the retained
slashes so that they are treated as part of the filename itself instead of as a
directory separator.

=item * terms

Allows you to supply your own special term conversions, or override any default
ones provided by this module. This is helpful in the event that your wiki uses
words or phrases which are mangled in unfortunate ways. The keys of the hashref
should be the terms (case-insensitive) as they appear in your wiki titles and
the values should be the form to which they should be converted. For example,
to keep a sane version of 'C++' in your wiki titles for GitLab (where the plus
sign is not allowed), you might do:

    gfmtitle('Languages/C++', { terms => { 'c++' => 'c-plus-plus' } });

=head1 LIMITATIONS

This module makes a few concessions to sloppiness (and tolerated, though not
official, markup), but for the most part it assumes your source content in the
TracWiki markup is generally well-formed and valid.

=head2 Tables

Tables, specifically, will face known limitations in their conversion. GFM
tables do not support row or column spanning, and cannot handle multi-line
contents in the markup (the newline will terminate the current cell's content).
As a result, complicated table markup from TracWiki pages will likely need to
be hand-wrangled after the conversion.

In addition to the lack of spanning in GFM, this converter will base the cell
alignment on the contents of the first row. While TracWiki markup allows each
cell to have its own independent alignment, GFM tables set the alignment on a
per-column basis using markup in the headers.

Headers are also mandatory in GFM tables, whereas they are optional in TracWiki.
The first row of every TracWiki table will be used as the header in the GFM
table, regardless of whether it included the C<||=Foo=||> markup.

=head1 BUGS

There are no known bugs at the time of this release. There may well be some
misfeatures, though.
